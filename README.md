# kryptos-k4_vigenere-symmetry
Algorithmic implementation of the Avirai's proposition to solve KRYPTOS' K4 via the 'KRYPTOS' Vigen√®re's table with randomized initial position and symmetry transposition via a pair of inversed matrices (cf. https://www.reddit.com/r/codes/comments/wwqj3m/kryptos_yar_east_north_east_and_muko/)

KRYPTOS' K4 doesn't budge for now over 35 years, despite the efforts of thousands of cryptanalysts, mathematicians, and artists. It is a testament to poor ciphering decisions and the creator's amateurism. 

It will die out with its creator soon enough, he's 75 after all. Such flawed codes should be forgotten.
